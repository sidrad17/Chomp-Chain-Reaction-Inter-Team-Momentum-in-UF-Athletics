We recommend using PyCharm as the IDE, as it is the platform on which all code was created.  

Scraping Data:  
All csv files needed to run main.py have been provided.
However, if the user wishes to test and run the scraper to obtain the 
csv files themselves, they must run run_scraper.py. This file
will scrape and clean the necessary data, adding them to folder titled cleaned_data.
Manual changes must then be made to this data to account for missing years and inconsistencies.
Additions are as follows.  
  
football.csv:

basketball.csv:

baseball.csv:

soccer.csv:

tennis.csv:

womens_tennis.csv:

The other csv files (volleyball.csv, softball.csv, and womens_basketball.csv) do not require additional editing.

Running main.py:  
In order to run main.py and user the interface, the user must simply run the code on their chosen IDE.
